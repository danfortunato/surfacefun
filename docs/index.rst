Surfacefun is MATLAB package for numerically computing with functions on
surfaces with high-order accuracy. It provides abstractions for managing
high-order unstructured :doc:`surface meshes <surfacemesh>`, representing
:doc:`scalar functions and vector fields <surfacefun>`, and efficiently
:doc:`solving partial differential equations (PDEs) <surfaceop>`. It is
particularly fast at the latter. See :doc:`the examples <examples>` for some
applications of surface PDEs.
