Installation
============

To install the Surfacefun MATLAB package, follow these steps.

1. In a terminal, clone the source repository from GitHub:

   .. code-block:: console

      git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/danfortunato/surfacefun.git

2. In MATLAB, change to the directory where the repository was cloned, then
   change to the ``surfacefun`` directory:

   .. code-block:: matlabsession

      >> cd 'surfacefun'

3. Now add the source files to your MATLAB path by running:

   .. code-block:: matlabsession

      >> setup

4. (Optional) If you would like this path to persist between MATLAB sessions, you may save
   it by running:

   .. code-block:: matlabsession

      >> savepath
