# Surfacefun

[![Documentation Status](https://readthedocs.org/projects/surfacefun/badge/?version=latest)](https://surfacefun.readthedocs.io/en/latest/?badge=latest)

Surfacefun is a MATLAB package for numerically computing with functions on surfaces with high-order accuracy. It provides abstractions for managing high-order unstructured surface meshes, representing scalar functions and vector fields, and efficiently solving partial differential equations (PDEs). It is particularly fast at the latter. See the examples for some applications of surface PDEs.
